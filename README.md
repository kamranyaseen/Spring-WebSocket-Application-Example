# Spring-WebSocket-Application-Example
Spring WebSocket Application with SpringBoot + SockJS + STOMP

 WebSocket protocol provides new capability for web applications: full-duplex, two-way communication. So in the system where the client and server need to exchange data at high frequency and with low latency.

 SockJS lets applications use a WebSocket API but falls back to non-WebSocket alternatives when necessary at runtime, without the need to change application code.
